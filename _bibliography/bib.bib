The two sophisticated heuristic solvers LKH and EAX and respective (restart) variants manage to calculate close-to optimal or even optimal solutions, also for large instances with several thousand nodes in reasonable time. In this work we extend existing benchmarking studies by addressing anytime behaviour of inexact TSP solvers based on empirical runtime distributions leading to an increased understanding of solver behaviour and the respective relation to problem hardness. It turns out that performance ranking of solvers is highly dependent on the focused approximation quality. Insights on intersection points of performances offer huge potential for the construction of hybridized solvers depending on instance features. Moreover, instance features tailored to anytime performance and corresponding performance indicators will highly improve automated algorithm selection models by including comprehensive information on solver quality.},

Intuitively, similar observations should hold for multi-criteria variants of such problems. In this work, we focus on the multi-criteria MST problem. A thorough experimental study is conducted where we estimate the probability of edges being part of non-dominated spanning trees as a function of the edges' non-domination level or domination count, respectively. Building on gained insights, we propose several biased one-edge-exchange mutation operators that differ in the used edge-selection probability distribution (biased towards edges of low rank). Our empirical analysis shows that among different graph types (dense and sparse) and edge weight types (both uniformly random and combinations of Euclidean and uniformly random) biased edge-selection strategies perform superior in contrast to the baseline uniform edge-selection. Our findings are in particular strong for dense graphs.},

In our experiments, we simulate different decision maker strategies and evaluate the development of the Pareto-front approximations on exemplary problem instances. It turns out, that despite severely reduced computational budget and no oracle-knowledge of request times the dynamic EMOA is capable of producing approximations which partially dominate the results of the a-posteriori EMOA and dynamic integer linear programming strategies.},

In this paper we study evolutionary diversity optimization for the knapsack problem (KP). Our goal is to evolve a population of solutions that all have a profit of at least (1 - {$\epsilon$}) {$\cdot$} OPT, where OPT is the value of an optimal solution. Furthermore, they should differ in structure with respect to an entropy-based diversity measure. To this end we propose a simple ({$\mu$} + 1)-EA with initial approximate solutions calculated by a well-known FPTAS for the KP. We investigate the effect of different standard mutation operators and introduce biased mutation and crossover which puts strong probability on flipping bits of low and/or high frequency within the population. An experimental study on different instances and settings shows that the proposed mutation operators in most cases perform slightly inferior in the long term, but show strong benefits if the number of function evaluations is severely limited.},

As in classical VRPs, tours have to be planned short while the number of serviced customers has to be maximized at the same time resulting in a multi-objective problem. Beyond that, however, dynamic requests lead to the need for re-planning of not yet realized tour parts, while already realized tour parts are irreversible. In this paper we study this type of bi-objective dynamic VRP including sequential decision making and concurrent realization of decisions. We adopt a recently proposed Dynamic Evolutionary Multi-Objective Algorithm (DEMOA) for a related VRP problem and extend it to the more realistic (here considered) scenario of multiple vehicles. We empirically show that our DEMOA is competitive with a multi-vehicle offline and clairvoyant variant of the proposed DEMOA as well as with the dynamic single-vehicle approach proposed earlier.},

Theoretical insights into the working principles of baseline evolutionary algorithms for diversity optimization are still rare. In this paper we study the well-known Minimum Spanning Tree problem (MST) in the context of diversity optimization where population diversity is measured by the sum of pairwise edge overlaps. Theoretical results provide insights into the fitness landscape of the MST diversity optimization problem pointing out that even for a population of {$\mu$} = 2 fitness plateaus (of constant length) can be reached, but nevertheless diverse sets can be calculated in polynomial time. We supplement our theoretical results with a series of experiments for the unconstrained and constraint case where all solutions need to fulfill a minimal quality threshold. Our results show that a simple ({$\mu$} + 1)-EA can effectively compute a diversified population of spanning trees of high quality.},

We consider two variants, classic one-shot optimization (where our aim is to find at least one solution of high quality) and one-shot regression (where the goal is to fit a model that resembles the true problem as well as possible). For both tasks it seems intuitive that well-distributed samples should perform better than uniform or grid-based samples, since they show a better coverage of the decision space. In practice, quasi-random designs such as Latin Hypercube Samples and low-discrepancy point sets are indeed very commonly used designs for one-shot optimization tasks. We study in this work how well low star discrepancy correlates with performance in one-shot optimization. Our results confirm an advantage of low-discrepancy designs, but also indicate the correlation between discrepancy values and overall performance is rather weak. We then demonstrate that commonly used designs may be far from optimal. More precisely, we evolve 24 very specific designs that each achieve good performance on one of our benchmark problems. Interestingly, we find that these specifically designed samples yield surprisingly good performance across the whole benchmark set. Our results therefore give strong indication that significant performance gains over state-of-the-art one-shot sampling techniques are possible, and that evolutionary algorithms can be an efficient means to evolve these.},

  abstract = {In recent years, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have frequently been adopted to evolve instances for optimization problems that pose difficulties for one algorithm while being rather easy for a competitor and vice versa. Typically, this is achieved by either minimizing or maximizing the performance difference or ratio which serves as the fitness function. Repeating this process is useful to gain insights into strengths/weaknesses of certain algorithms or to build a set of instances with strong performance differences as a foundation for automatic per-instance algorithm selection or configuration. We contribute to this branch of research by proposing fitness-functions to evolve instances that show large performance differences for more than just two algorithms simultaneously. As a proof-of-principle, we evolve instances of the multi-component Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) for three incomplete TTP-solvers. Our results point out that our strategies are promising, but unsurprisingly their success strongly relies on the algorithms' performance complementarity.},

  abstract = {Sequential model-based optimization (SMBO) approaches are algorithms for solving problems that require computationally or otherwise expensive function evaluations. The key design principle of SMBO is a substitution of the true objective function by a surrogate, which is used to propose the point(s) to be evaluated next. SMBO algorithms are intrinsically modular, leaving the user with many important design choices. Significant research efforts go into understanding which settings perform best for which type of problems. Most works, however, focus on the choice of the model, the acquisition function, and the strategy used to optimize the latter. The choice of the initial sampling strategy, however, receives much less attention. Not surprisingly, quite diverging recommendations can be found in the literature. We analyze in this work how the size and the distribution of the initial sample influences the overall quality of the efficient global optimization (EGO) algorithm, a well-known SMBO approach. While, overall, small initial budgets using Halton sampling seem preferable, we also observe that the performance landscape is rather unstructured. We furthermore identify several situations in which EGO performs unfavorably against random sampling. Both observations indicate that an adaptive SMBO design could be beneficial, making SMBO an interesting test-bed for automated algorithm design.},

Since the manual exploration of the parameter space is tedious -- even for few parameters -- several automatic procedures for parameter tuning have been proposed. Recent approaches also take into account some characteristic properties of the problem instances, frequently termed instance features. Our contribution is the proposal of a novel concept for feature-based algorithm parameter tuning, which applies an approximating surrogate model for learning the continuous feature-parameter mapping. To accomplish this, we learn a joint model of the algorithm performance based on both the algorithm parameters and the instance features. The required data is gathered using a recently proposed acquisition function for model refinement in surrogate-based optimization: the profile expected improvement. This function provides an avenue for maximizing the information required for the feature-parameter mapping, i.e., the mapping from instance features to the corresponding optimal algorithm parameters. The approach is validated by applying the tuner to exemplary evolutionary algorithms and problems, for which theoretically grounded or heuristically determined feature-parameter mappings are available.},

We show that EAs can solve the graph coloring problem for bipartite graphs more efficiently by using dynamic optimization. In our approach the graph instance is given incrementally such that the EA can reoptimize its coloring when a new edge introduces a conflict. We show that, when edges are inserted in a way that preserves graph connectivity, Randomized Local Search (RLS) efficiently finds a proper 2-coloring for all bipartite graphs. This includes graphs for which RLS and other EAs need exponential expected time in a static optimization scenario. We investigate different ways of building up the graph by popular graph traversals such as breadth-first-search and depth-first-search and analyse the resulting runtime behavior. We further show that offspring populations (e. g. a (1 + {$\lambda$}) RLS) lead to an exponential speedup in {$\lambda$}. Finally, an island model using 3 islands succeeds in an optimal time of {$\Theta$}(m) on every m-edge bipartite graph, outperforming offspring populations. This is the first example where an island model guarantees a speedup that is not bounded in the number of islands.},

In the area of evolutionary computation, the Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) has gained increasing interest over the last 5 years. In this paper, we investigate the effect of weights on such problems, in the sense that the cost of traveling increases with respect to the weights of nodes already visited during a tour. This provides abstractions of important TSP variants such as the Traveling Thief Problem and time dependent TSP variants, and allows to study precisely the increase in difficulty caused by weight dependence. We provide a 3.59-approximation for this weight dependent version of TSP with metric distances and bounded positive weights. Furthermore, we conduct experimental investigations for simple randomized local search with classical mutation operators and two variants of the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithm EAX adapted to the weighted TSP. Our results show the impact of the node weights on the position of the nodes in the resulting tour.},

The Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) addresses such interactions by combining two combinatorial optimisation problems, namely the TSP and the Knapsack Problem (KP). Recently, a new problem called the node weight dependent Traveling Salesperson Problem (W-TSP) has been introduced where nodes have weights that influence the cost of the tour. In this paper, we compare W-TSP and TTP. We investigate the structure of the optimised tours for W-TSP and TTP and the impact of using each others fitness function. Our experimental results suggest (1) that the W-TSP often can be solved better using the TTP fitness function and (2) final W-TSP and TTP solutions show different distributions when compared with optimal TSP or weighted greedy solutions.},

The available and most notable approaches by Zhou and Gen as well as by Knowles and Corne concentrate on solution encoding and on fairly dated selection mechanisms. In this work, we revisit the mcMST and focus on the mutation operators as exploratory components of evolutionary algorithms neglected so far. We investigate optimal solution characteristics to discuss current mutation strategies, identify shortcomings of these operators, and propose a sub-tree based operator which offers what we term Pareto-beneficial behavior: ensuring convergence and diversity at the same time. The operator is empirically evaluated inside modern standard evolutionary meta-heuristics for multi-criteria optimization and compared to hitherto applied mutation operators in the context of mcMST.},

We identify classes of bipartite graphs where reoptimization is as hard as or even harder than optimization from scratch, i. e. starting with a random initialization. Even adding a single edge can lead to hard symmetry problems. However, graph classes that are hard for one algorithm turn out to be easy for others.

We present the first runtime analysis of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for the edge coloring problem. Simple EAs such as RLS and (1+1) EA efficiently find (2{$\Delta$} - 1)-colorings on arbitrary graphs and optimal colorings for even and odd cycles, paths, star graphs and arbitrary trees. A partial analysis for toroids also suggests efficient runtimes in bipartite graphs with many cycles. Experiments support these findings and investigate additional graph classes such as hypercubes, complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs. Theoretical and experimental results suggest that simple EAs find optimal colorings for all these graph classes in expected time O({$\Delta\mathscr{l}$}2m log m), where m is the number of edges and {$\mathscr{l}$} is the length of the longest simple path in the graph.},

  abstract = {We contribute to the theoretical understanding of randomized search heuristics for dynamic problems. We consider the classical vertex coloring problem on graphs and investigate the dynamic setting where edges are added to the current graph. We then analyze the expected time for randomized search heuristics to recompute high quality solutions. The (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm and RLS operate in a setting where the number of colors is bounded and we are minimizing the number of conflicts. Iterated local search algorithms use an unbounded color palette and aim to use the smallest colors and, consequently, the smallest number of colors. We identify classes of bipartite graphs where reoptimization is as hard as or even harder than optimization from scratch, i.e., starting with a random initialization. Even adding a single edge can lead to hard symmetry problems. However, graph classes that are hard for one algorithm turn out to be easy for others. In most cases our bounds show that reoptimization is faster than optimizing from scratch. We further show that tailoring mutation operators to parts of the graph where changes have occurred can significantly reduce the expected reoptimization time. In most settings the expected reoptimization time for such tailored algorithms is linear in the number of added edges. However, tailored algorithms cannot prevent exponential times in settings where the original algorithm is inefficient.},

  abstract = {We consider a dynamic bi-objective vehicle routing problem, where a subset of customers ask for service over time. Therein, the distance traveled by a single vehicle and the number of unserved dynamic requests is minimized by a dynamic evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (DEMOA), which operates on discrete time windows (eras). A decision is made at each era by a decision-maker, thus any decision depends on irreversible decisions made in foregoing eras. To understand effects of sequences of decision-making and interactions/dependencies between decisions made, we conduct a series of experiments. More precisely, we fix a set of decision-maker preferences D and the number of eras n{$<$}inf{$>$}t{$<$}/inf{$>$} and analyze all \$|D|\^\{n\_\{t\}\}\$ combinations of decision-maker options. We find that for random uniform instances (a) the final selected solutions mainly depend on the final decision and not on the decision history, (b) solutions are quite robust with respect to the number of unvisited dynamic customers, and (c) solutions of the dynamic approach can even dominate solutions obtained by a clairvoyant EMOA. In contrast, for instances with clustered customers, we observe a strong dependency on decision-making history as well as more variance in solution diversity.},

A core research area in stream data is stream classification, which categorizes or detects data points within an evolving stream of observations. Areas of stream classification are diverse\textemdash ranging, e.g., from monitoring sensor data to analyzing a wide range of (social) media applications. Research in stream classification is related to developing methods that adapt to the changing and potentially volatile data stream. It focuses on individual aspects of the stream classification pipeline, e.g., designing suitable algorithm architectures, an efficient train and test procedure, or detecting so-called concept drifts. As a result of the many different research questions and strands, the field is challenging to grasp, especially for beginners. This survey explores, summarizes, and categorizes work within the domain of stream classification and identifies core research threads over the past few years. It is structured based on the stream classification process to facilitate coordination within this complex topic, including common application scenarios and benchmarking data sets. Thus, both newcomers to the field and experts who want to widen their scope can gain (additional) insight into this research area and find starting points and pointers to more in-depth literature on specific issues and research directions in the field.},

We illustrate why commonly used diversity measures are not entirely appropriate for this task and propose a sophisticated basin-based evaluation (BBE) method. Also, BBE variants are developed, capturing the anytime behavior of algorithms. The set of BBE measures is tested by means of an algorithm configuration study. We show that these new measures also transfer properties of the well-established hypervolume (HV) indicator to the domain of MMMOO, thus also accounting for objective space convergence. Moreover, we advance MMMOO research by providing insights into the multimodal performance of the considered algorithms. Specifically, algorithms exploiting local structures are shown to outperform classical evolutionary multi-objective optimizers regarding the BBE variants and respective trade-off with HV.},

  abstract = {Recently different evolutionary computation approaches have been developed that generate sets of high quality diverse solutions for a given optimisation problem. Many studies have considered diversity 1) as a mean to explore niches in behavioural space (quality diversity) or 2) to increase the structural differences of solutions (evolutionary diversity optimisation). In this study, we introduce a co-evolutionary algorithm to simultaneously explore the two spaces for the multi-component traveling thief problem. The results show the capability of the co-evolutionary algorithm to achieve significantly higher diversity compared to the baseline evolutionary diversity algorithms from the literature.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms based on edge assembly crossover (EAX) constitute some of the best performing incomplete solvers for the well-known traveling salesperson problem (TSP). Often, it is desirable to compute not just a single solution for a given problem, but a diverse set of high quality solutions from which a decision maker can choose one for implementation. Currently, there are only a few approaches for computing a diverse solution set for the TSP. Furthermore, almost all of them assume that the optimal solution is known. In this paper, we introduce evolutionary diversity optimisation (EDO) approaches for the TSP that find a diverse set of tours when the optimal tour is known or unknown. We show how to adopt EAX to not only find a high-quality solution but also to maximise the diversity of the population. The resulting EAX-based EDO approach, termed EAX-EDO is capable of obtaining diverse high-quality tours when the optimal solution for the TSP is known or unknown. A comparison to existing approaches shows that they are clearly outperformed by EAX-EDO.},

  abstract = {Computing diverse sets of high-quality solutions has gained increasing attention among the evolutionary computation community in recent years. It allows practitioners to choose from a set of high-quality alternatives. In this paper, we employ a population diversity measure, called the high-order entropy measure, in an evolutionary algorithm to compute a diverse set of high-quality solutions for the Traveling Salesperson Problem. In contrast to previous studies, our approach allows diversifying segments of tours containing several edges based on the entropy measure. We examine the resulting evolutionary diversity optimisation approach precisely in terms of the final set of solutions and theoretical properties. Experimental results show significant improvements compared to a recently proposed edge-based diversity optimisation approach when working with a large population of solutions or long segments.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are general-purpose problem solvers that usually perform an unbiased search. This is reasonable and desirable in a black-box scenario. For combinatorial optimization problems, often more knowledge about the structure of optimal solutions is given, which can be leveraged by means of biased search operators. We consider the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem in a single- and multi-objective version, and introduce a biased mutation, which puts more emphasis on the selection of edges of low rank in terms of low domination number. We present example graphs where the biased mutation can significantly speed up the expected runtime until (Pareto-)optimal solutions are found. On the other hand, we demonstrate that bias can lead to exponential runtime if "heavy" edges are necessarily part of an optimal solution. However, on general graphs in the single-objective setting, we show that a combined mutation operator which decides for unbiased or biased edge selection in each step with equal probability exhibits a polynomial upper bound - as unbiased mutation - in the worst case and benefits from bias if the circumstances are favorable.},

  abstract = {In this work we focus on the well-known Euclidean Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) and two highly competitive inexact heuristic TSP solvers, EAX and LKH, in the context of per-instance algorithm selection (AS). We evolve instances with nodes where the solvers show strongly different performance profiles. These instances serve as a basis for an exploratory study on the identification of well-discriminating problem characteristics (features). Our results in a nutshell: we show that even though (1) promising features exist, (2) these are in line with previous results from the literature, and (3) models trained with these features are more accurate than models adopting sophisticated feature selection methods, the advantage is not close to the virtual best solver in terms of penalized average runtime and so is the performance gain over the single best solver. However, we show that a feature-free deep neural network based approach solely based on visual representation of the instances already matches classical AS model results and thus shows huge potential for future studies.},
