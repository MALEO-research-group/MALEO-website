<p>Heinz-Georg organized a wonderful farewell event that brought together many colleagues, both past and present. The gathering was filled with laughter, memories, and a sense of camaraderie that spoke to the impact Heinz-Georg has had on his colleagues at Paderborn University.</p>

<p>We are grateful for his contributions in building up the MALEO group! While we will miss him dearly, we wish Heinz-Georg all the best in this exciting new chapter. Thank you for everything, Heinz-Georg, you will always be part of the MALEO family!</p>
