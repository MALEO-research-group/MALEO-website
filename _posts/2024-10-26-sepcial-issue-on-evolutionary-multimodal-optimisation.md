title: Announcement - Special Issue on Evolutionary Multi-Modal Optimization in Mathematical and Computational Applications
---
<p>As already announced during the <a href="https://mmmoo-workshop.github.io" class="external">MMMOO-workshop at PPSN2024</a>, we are organizing a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/mca/special_issues/T9AM7T7292" class="external">special issue (SI) on Evolutionary Multimodal Optimization</a>.</p>

<p>The SI will be published in the journal Mathematical and Computational Applications (JCR, Q2). The journal MCA is open access, but for attendees of the workshop we will waive the APC (currently 1400 Swiss Francs).</p>

<p>We hence welcome you hereby to submit a paper related to the topic of the SI!</p>
