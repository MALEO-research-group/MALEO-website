<p>We are happy to announce that we have two journal articles accepted for publication! Congrats to all authors!</p>

<p>The paper <i>MO-SMAC: Multi-Objective Sequential Model-based Algorithm Configuration</i> by <a href='{{ "/staff.html" | absolute_url }}#staff_member_jrook'>Jeroen Rook</a> and colleagues is accepted at the <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/evco" class="external" title = "Official website of the ECJ (external link)">Evolutionary Computation Journal</a> (ECJ). The paper introduces a multi-objective version of the well-knwoen Sequential Model-Based Algorithm Configurator (SMAC).</p>

<p><a href='{{ "/staff.html" | absolute_url }}#staff_member_mseiler'>Moritz</a> co-authored the paper <i>Landscape Features in Single-Objective Continuous Optimization: Have We Hit a Wall in Algorithm Selection Generalization?</i> that was recently accepted for publication ins the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/swarm-and-evolutionary-computation" class = "external" title = "Official website of the Swarm and Evolutionary Computation journal (external link)">Swarm and Evolutionary Computation Journal</a>. As the title suggests the paper discussed exploratory landscape features and their limitation in the context of single-objective continuous optimisation.</p>
