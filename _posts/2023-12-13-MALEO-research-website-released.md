title: MALEO research website released
---

<p>Finally, our <b>new MALEO research website</b> is online! The webpages contain information on our <a href="{{ "research.html" | absolute_url }}" class="internal" title="Research at MALEO">group research</a>, our <a href="{{ "staff.html" | absolute_url }}" class="internal" title="MALEO staff members">individual research profiles</a> alongside pointers to external resources.</p>

<p>Things have been going pretty fine so far! One can say that we had a very good start at Paderborn University.</p>

<p><b>MALEO is growing!</b> Dr. Britta Grimme joined us as a PostDoc in early December. Urban Skorc will join MALEO in January as a PhD student alongside two student assistants, Harshit Purohit and Soumitri Mukherjee, who will support us in our scientific endeavours.</p>
