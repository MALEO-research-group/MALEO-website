<p>The <i>Rothenberge Mansion (Schloss Rothenberge)</i> is a historical building owned by the University of Münster in Germany. Located in a picturesque countryside around 30 kilometers northwest of Münster, it serves as a retreat and conference center for the university. Because of its quiet location and scenic surroundings, it provides a peaceful atmosphere ideal for focused work, discussions, and intellectual exchanges. The building is fully equipped for modern academic needs while preserving its historical charm.</p>

<p>Our group took part in a collaborative workshop with the <a href="https://www.wi.uni-muenster.de/department/csssa" class="external" title="Website of the Computational Social Science and Systems Analysis group at the University of Münster">Computational Social Science and Systems Analysis</a> group at Münster University and the <a href="https://tu-dresden.de/bu/verkehr/ivw/bda/die-professur" class="external" title="Website of the Chair for Big Data Analytics in Transportation at the Technische Universität Dresden">Big Data Analytics in Transportation</a> group at the Technische Universität Dresden.</p>

<p>We had an insightful and dynamic collaborative workshop focused on social media analytics, multi-objective optimisation, and related topics in the intersection of the groups' scientific focus areas! We are looking for the next edition of the workshop (hopefully) in 2025!</p>
