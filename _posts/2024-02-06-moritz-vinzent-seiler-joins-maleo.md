<p>MALEO is growing further! We are excited to welcome <a href='{{ "/staff.html" | absolute_url }}#staff_member_mseiler'>Moritz Vinzent Seiler</a>! Moritz recently received his doctorate degree in Information Systems from the University of MÃ¼nster under mainly supervised by MALEO group leader <a href='{{ "/staff.html" | absolute_url }}#staff_member_htrautmann'>Prof. Heike Trautmann</a>. Thus, Moritz has been a good colleague for many years and we are delighted that he decided to continue his academic career at Paderborn University.</p>
