The goal of the BMBF-funded joint project "Real-Time Detection and Identification of Hybrid Disinformation Campaigns in Online Media (HybriD)" is to develop a software-based analysis tool that helps experts to better assess disinformation campaigns. The interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, communication scientists and IT security service providers combines machine learning with human expertise to identify disinformation campaigns. The analysis tool will make it possible to evaluate large volumes of data from online media and social networks in real time and to detect temporal patterns. Using this database, experts can comprehensively assess disinformation campaigns and their impact. These findings are then returned to the tool, allowing new patterns to be learned. Iteratively, general statements about disinformation patterns can be made and so-called "archetypes" of disinformation can be identified. This is intended to answer the question given at the outset about the emergence and spread of disinformation as well as the possibilities for action.
