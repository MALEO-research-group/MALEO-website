Using rail mobility to contribute to highly automated, digitalised and sustainable mobility and to rethink interfaces with other modes of transport - this is the aim of the project "Automated rail transport as the basis for sustainable, networked mobility in rural areas (enableATO)", in which researchers from Paderborn University are involved. The project will be based at the RailCampus OWL in Minden. Minden is thus one of four locations within the DZM (German Centre for Future Mobility).

Over the next three years, a strong project consortium of universities, Fraunhofer institutes in the region and companies will advance technologies for automated, rail-based mobility concepts and research and identify interfaces between rail-based mobility and other modes of transport in rural areas. Driverless rail transport systems such as the MONOCAB or the road-rail vehicle will demonstrate automated rail transport in Minden and Extertal. The aim is to use them in regular test operations in the near future.

The funding of 12.5 million euros is being provided by the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport Affairs (BMDV).

The aim of the "enableATO" project is to enable modern ideas for automated rail mobility and their investigation in new rail-based approaches in rural areas. The focus is on technologies related to automated driving such as perception by sensors, authorisation issues, intelligent maintenance and the demonstration of technologies, e.g. in the MONOCAB. At the same time, initial questions regarding user acceptance are being researched and addressed and the scientific dialogue strengthened.

The challenge of transport system transformation is to combine sustainability and efficiency. Automation, autonomous driving, intelligent traffic management, digital connectivity and networked mobility play a central role in this context. The RailCampus OWL as an innovation centre for this project provides space for new impulses and makes a decisive contribution to the research and development of new automated mobility approaches for sustainable rail mobility as a socially relevant factor.
