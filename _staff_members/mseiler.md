In 2023, Moritz successfully defended his doctoral thesis which was supervised by Prof. Dr. Heike Trautmann. His thesis focused on the development of Feature-Free Automated Algorithm Selection and Configuration, with a particular focus on Deep Learning. Moritz also earned both his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Information Systems from the University of MÃ¼nster, completing his undergraduate studies in 2016 and his graduate studies in 2018. Presently, his research focus is on foundation models for feature learning in the context of continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. This research aims to explore a different and more sophisticated way for feature generation of various optimization domains aiming to path way into novel domains that currently lack any sophisticated feature sets.
