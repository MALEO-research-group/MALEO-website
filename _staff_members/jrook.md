Jeroen received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Science at Leiden University, The Netherlands, in 2018 and 2021, respectively. He specialised in artificial intelligence and advanced data analytics in his master and wrote his thesis on the topics of model counters and automated algorithm configuration. His experience with these meta-algorithmics during his thesis research sparked his interest in that domain. Currently, he is pursuing his PhD degree at the University of Twente, The Netherlands, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Heike Trautmann, Prof. Dr. Holger H. Hoos and Dr. Ir. Maurice van Keulen.

The research of Jeroen is on multi-objective approaches for automated algorithm selection and configuration. Many real-world problems often have more than one performance objective; however, most existing configuration and selection frameworks usually focus on single objectives. By producing multi-objective approaches, Jeroen aims to make meta-algorithmics more statistically robust, versatile and powerful.
Consequently, his broader research interests lie in multi-objective optimisation and algorithm benchmarking.
