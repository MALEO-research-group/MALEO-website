After training as a secretary at the Paderborn University, Marion Hucke joined Prof. Burkhard Monien's Parallel Computing Group in 1991. Following the emeritus of Prof. Monien in 2009, she became secretary to Prof. Christian Scheideler in the Theory of Distributed Systems group. She continued to perform various secretarial tasks for Professor Monien, who was secretary of the "Engineering Sciences" class at the Academy of Sciences. When the Collaborative Research Centre "On-the-fly Computing" started in 2011, Marion worked as administrative assistant to the CRC director, Dr. Ulf-Peter Schroeder, and also to Prof. Scheideler. The CRC ended in June 2023 after the third funding period with a total of 12 successful years. In October 2023, Marion started working as an administrative assistant for Prof. Heike Trautmann, Chair of Machine Learning and Optimisation, and for Prof. Ivan Habernal, Chair of Natural Language Processing.
